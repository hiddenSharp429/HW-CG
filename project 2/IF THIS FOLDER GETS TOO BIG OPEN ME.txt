the big size is probably because of Visual Studio's pre-compiled headers:

as mentioned online, you can safely delete these folders:
cglib.vsnet\ipch
cglib.vsnet\.vs\cglib\v17\ipch
OpenGLRacingPOSCADEIRA\cglib.vsnet\ipch
OpenGLRacingPOSCADEIRA\cglib.vsnet\.vs\cglib\v17\ipch

(and probably other files and folders as well... but check online first)
